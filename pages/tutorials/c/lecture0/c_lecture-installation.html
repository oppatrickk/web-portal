                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">To start learning C programming, you only have to install the C compiler in
                        your system, and nowadays C and C++ both compilers come as a single integrated package, which
                        serves the purpose of C and C++ both program development.</p>

                    <h5 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">What is Compiler in C?</h5>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A <a href="../../../../../../../Desktop/Ryan/c%20updated/other/compilers.html"
                                              target="_blank">compiler</a> is a computer program that transforms
                        human-readable (programming language) source code into another computer language (binary) code.
                        <br> In simple terms, Compiler takes the code that you wrote and turned in to the binary code
                        that the computer can understand.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The C compiler is a software application that transforms the human-readable C
                        program code to machine-readable code. The process of transforming the code from High-Level
                        Language to Machine Level Language is called "Compilation". The human-readable code is the C
                        program that consists of digits letters, special symbols, etc. which is understood by human
                        beings. On the other hand, machine language is dependent on the processor and processor
                        understands zeroes and ones (binary) only. All C program execution is based on a processor which
                        is available in the CPU; that is why entire C source code needs to be converted to the binary
                        system by the compiler.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This tutorial is written for Windows, Unix / Linux, and MAC users. All code has
                        been tested, and it works correctly on all three operating systems.</p>
