                            <ul>
                                <li>Difficult to debug.</li>
                                <li>C allows a lot of freedom in writing code, and that is why you can put an empty line or white space anywhere in the program. And because there is no fixed place to start or end the line, so it isn't easy to read and understand the program.</li>
                                <li>C compilers can only identify errors and are incapable of handling exceptions (run-time errors).</li>
                                <li>C provides no data protection.</li>
                                <li>It also doesn't feature the reusability of source code extensively.</li>
                                <li>It does not provide strict data type checking (for example, an integer value can be passed for floating datatype).</li>
