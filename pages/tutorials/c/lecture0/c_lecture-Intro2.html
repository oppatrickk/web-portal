                        <ul>
                            <li>In <b>1988</b>, the <b>American National Standards Institute (ANSI)</b> had formalized the C language.</li>
                            <li>C was invented to write <b>UNIX</b> operating system.</li>
                            <li>C is a successor of 'Basic Combined Programming Language' (BCPL) called <b>B language</b>.</li>
                            <li><b>Linux OS</b>, <b>PHP</b>, and <b>MySQL</b> are written in C.</li>
                            <li>C has been written in assembly language.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Features of C Programming Language</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>C is a robust language with a rich set of built-in functions and operators.</li>
                            <li>Programs written in C are efficient and fast.</li>
                            <li>C is highly portable; programs once written in C can be run on other machines with minor or no modification.</li>
                            <li>C is a collection of C library functions; we can also create our function and add it to the C library.</li>
                            <li>C is easily extensible.</li>
