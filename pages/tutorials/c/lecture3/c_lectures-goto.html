                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">So far we have discussed the <span class="highlight">if&nbsp;statements</span>
                        and how it is used in C to control statement execution based on some decisions or conditions.
                        The flow of execution also depends on other statements which are not based on conditions that
                        can control the flow.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">C supports a unique form of a statement that is the <span class="highlight">goto</span>
                        Statement which is used to branch unconditionally within a program from one point to another.
                        Although it is not a good habit to use the goto statement in C, there may be some situations
                        where the use of the goto statement might be desirable.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The goto statement is used by programmers to change the sequence of execution
                        of a C program by shifting the control to a different part of the same program.</p>
                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"><u>The general form of the goto statement is:</u></p>

                            <p>A label is an identifier required for goto statement to a place where the branch is to be
                                made. A label is a valid variable name which is followed by a colon and is put
                                immediately before the statement where the control needs to be jumped/transferred
                                unconditionally.</p>
