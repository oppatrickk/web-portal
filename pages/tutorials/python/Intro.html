        <h2>Introduction to Python</h2>
        <p><b>Python</b> is a very popular general-purpose programming language which was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. It is open-source and you can freely use & distribute Python, even for commercial use. It is very popular for web
            development and you can build almost anything like mobile apps, web apps, tools, data analytics, machine learning etc. It is designed to be simple and easy like english language. It's much easier to read and write Python programs compared
            to other languages like C++, Java, C#. It's is highly productive and efficient which makes it a very popular programming language.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To learn more about Python, you can check this following links:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python Website</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python (Wikipedia)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Get Started with Python?</h2>
        <h3>Install Python IDE</h3>>
        <p>1. Download the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" class="links">latest version of Python.</a></p>
        <p>2. Run the installer file and follow the steps to install Python During the install process, check <b>Add Python to environment variables. This</b> will add Python to environment variables, and you can run Python from any part of the computer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>1. Run Python in Immediate mode</h3>
        <p>You may deem to choose the path where you want to install your Python.</p>
        <img src="img/Python%20Images/python_installer.jpg">
        <br>
        <p>Once Python is installed, typing <b class="marking">python</b> in the command line will invoke the interpreter in immediate mode. We can directly type in Python code, and press Enter to get the output.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Try typing in <b class="marking">1 + 1</b> and press enter. We get <b class="marking">2</b> as the output. This prompt can be used as a calculator. To exit this mode, type <b class="marking">quit()</b> and press enter.</p>
        <img src="img/Python%20Images/python-run-command-mode.jpg">
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>2. Run Python in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h3>
        <p>We can use any text editing software to write a Python script file.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We just need to save it with the <b class="marking">.py</b> extension. But using an IDE can make our life a lot easier. IDE isa piece of software that provides useful features like code hinting, syntax highlighting and checking, file explorers,
            etc. to the programmer for application development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>By the way, when you install Python, an IDE named <b class="marking">IDLE</b> is also installed. You can use it to run Python on your computer. It's a decent IDE for beginners.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When you open IDLE, an interactive Python Shell is opened.</p>
        <img src="img/Python%20Images/idle-python.jpg">
        <br>
        <p>Now you can create a new file and save it with <b class="marking">.py</b> extension. For example, <b class="marking">hello.py</b></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Learning by Examples</h2>
        <h3>Let's start with your first Python Program</h3>
        <p>Now that you have a Python up and running, we can write our first Python program.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Let's create a very simple program called <b class="marking">Hello World</b>. A <b>"Hello, World!"</b> is a simple program that outputs <b class="marking">Hello, World!</b> on the screen. Since it's a very simple program, it's often used to introduce
            a new programming language to beginners.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Type the following code in any text editor or an IDE and save it as <b class="marking">hello_world.py</b></p>
        <div class="card" style="width: 30rem;">
            <div class="card-body bg-transparent text-black">
                <b>print("Hello, World!")</b>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Then, run the file. You will get the following output.</p>
        <div class="card" style="width: 30rem;">
            <div class="card-body bg-transparent text-black">
                <b>Hello, World!</b>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Congratulations! You just wrote your first program in Python.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As you can see, this was a pretty easy task. This is the beauty of the Python programming language.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Learning with Python Exercise</h2>
        <p>So in this session, you will learn the basics of Python through our simple exercise for each area. Let's begin.</p>
