                           Web Pages</p><br>
                          <p> <li>Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together.
                              Thus, the link available on webpages is called Hypertext</li><br>
                              <li>As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to 
                                simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web Browser how to structure it 
                                to display</li></p><br>
                                <p>Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents 
                                  like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific

                         <p>In its simplest form, the following is an example of an HTML document-</p>
                         <xmp>
                           <!DOCTYPE html>

                            <h1>This a heading</h1>

                        <br>

                       <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
                       <ul>
                         <p>As told earlier, HTML  is a Markup Language and makes use of various tags to format the content.
                            These tags are enclosed within angle braces "Tag Name". Except few tags, most of the tags have their 
                          corresponding closing tags. 
                          <xmp>For Example, <html> has its closing tag </html> and <body> tag has its closing tag </body> tag etc.</xmp></p>
                          Above example of HTML document uses the following tags-
                          <!DOCTYPE html>
                          <html>
                            <head>

                            </style> 
                            </head>
